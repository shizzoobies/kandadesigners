Phase 1 Push 4: Portrait panels + nav simplification

Changes:
- Added portrait support to people profiles (image field in content schema + frontmatter).
- Added placeholder images in public/images/people/.
- Updated PersonCard component to include portrait + studio styling.
- Increased global side gutters so content isn't tight to the edges.
- Simplified nav: Home, Alex, Kristina, Contact.
